My name is Trevor Trevains, and I am a student at Tufts University. I have been programming since 7th grade, where I started with C++. In my free time I like to read scientific, mathematical, and philosophical literature. I read a lot of webcomics like xkcd, smbc-comics, cyanide & happiness, etc. I am a big fan of science fiction novels and movie, being a huge fan of Asimov, Orwell, etc.
